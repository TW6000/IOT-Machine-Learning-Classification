In order to improve upon the models accuracy I next tried recording data with the device at my wrist, in the hope the extra hand movement would create features in the data the models could pick up on.

The effect this had was to only increase performance metrics of the decision tree model. I believe this was due to the fact it is able to adapt to the non linear structures in the data whereas Logistic Regression and SVM draw a straight line decision boundary.
