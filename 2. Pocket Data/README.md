I took recordings of two people walking and running with the device in my pocket and tested them with the model. 

The scores I recieved were no different than random guesses, suggesting my test data didn't match the models learned patterns and classes were difficult to seperate linearly. 

This could be due to a number of reasons, such as the point of measurement impacting acceleration and gyroscope readings, or differences in manner of walking.
